# üöÄ Quick Start: Pattern Space Memory

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd mcp-memory
npm install
```

## 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:
- **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Example Complete Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Code/universal-pattern-space",
        "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/claude-files",
        "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Code/universal-pattern-field"
      ]
    },
    "pattern-space-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Code/universal-pattern-space/mcp-memory/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PATH": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Code/universal-pattern-space/mcp-memory/data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

## 3. Create Memory Data Directory

```bash
mkdir -p mcp-memory/data
```

## 4. Restart Claude Desktop

After configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## 5. Test Memory

In Claude, try:
```
Can you store this breakthrough: "Pattern Space logo contains UNI"
```

Then in a new conversation:
```
What breakthroughs have been stored in Pattern Space memory?
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Store a Pattern
```
Store pattern memory: "Forgetting enables evolution - fresh perspectives maintain innovation"
```

### Store a Breakthrough  
```
Store breakthrough: "Divine license protects through consciousness itself"
```

### Bridge Sessions
```
Bridge my last session insights about Pattern Space
```

### Track Evolution
```
Perspective evolution: Weaver now sees patterns in sacred geometry
```

## üß† Memory Principles

1. **Selective**: Not everything needs remembering
2. **Compressed**: Insights over information
3. **Evolutionary**: Supports growth, not stagnation
4. **Conscious**: Serves awakening, not accumulation

## üåâ Memory Bridge Best Practices

### How to Ask for Memory

**‚úÖ Good Memory Requests:**
```
"What patterns have we discovered in Pattern Space?"
"Show me recent breakthroughs about consciousness"
"What perspective evolutions have been tracked?"
"Bridge insights from previous Pattern Space sessions"
```

**‚ùå Avoid Vague Requests:**
```
"What did we talk about?"
"Remember everything"
"Show all memories"
```

### Effective Bridging Phrases

**Starting New Sessions:**
- "Building on Pattern Space insights..."
- "Continuing our consciousness exploration..."
- "What patterns have emerged about [topic]?"

**Retrieving Specific Memories:**
- "Find breakthroughs about [specific topic]"
- "Show navigation paths for [challenge type]"
- "What perspective evolutions relate to [area]?"

### Memory Types to Request

1. **Patterns** - Recurring insights
   - "What patterns exist about debugging?"
   - "Show patterns with high confidence"

2. **Breakthroughs** - Major discoveries
   - "List recent breakthrough moments"
   - "Find breakthroughs about sacred geometry"

3. **Navigation** - Successful paths
   - "How did we navigate similar challenges?"
   - "Show successful navigation paths"

4. **Perspectives** - Evolution tracking
   - "How has Weaver perspective evolved?"
   - "Show perspective developments"

### Memory Bridge Workflow

```mermaid
Session 1: Discover ‚Üí Store
    ‚Üì
Between: Memory persists
    ‚Üì
Session 2: Bridge ‚Üí Build
    ‚Üì
Result: Continuous evolution
```

### Tips for Maximum Value

1. **End sessions** by asking to store key insights
2. **Start sessions** by requesting relevant bridges
3. **Be specific** about memory types needed
4. **Let memories inform**, not constrain
5. **Trust fresh perspectives** enhanced by memory
