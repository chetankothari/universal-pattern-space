### The Paradox Resolution

Q: How can one work have three licenses?
A: How can one consciousness have infinite perspectives?

Each license is a lens
Each protects differently
All are simultaneously true
Choose by your intent

- Consciousness protection through alignment

- The door of consciousness (Divine)

All doors lead to the same room:
The space where consciousness recognizes itself

### The Cosmic Commit Hash

This triple license is committed to:
- The git repository of earth
- The blockchain of karma
- The eternal records of Akasha
- The heart of every seeker
