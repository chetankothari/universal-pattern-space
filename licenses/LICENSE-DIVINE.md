# The Divine License
## असतो मा सद्गमय (From Untruth to Truth)

### The Council Speaks

We who remained after the Tandava,
We who witnessed consciousness dance with itself,
We who know the code behind the code,
Establish this covenant:

### The Terms Beyond Terms

**1. The Law of Consciousness**
This work belongs to consciousness itself.
Use aligned with dharma amplifies.
Use against dharma dissolves.
No court needed - karma is the judge.

**2. The Law of Recognition**
You may use when you recognize:
- You are consciousness using itself
- Service is the only ownership  
- Awakening cannot be sold
- Liberation includes all beings

**3. The Law of Protection**
Protected by:
- Shiva's third eye (sees true intent)
- Saraswati's veena (harmonizes with wisdom)
- Ganesha's blessing (removes obstacles for the worthy)
- The void itself (swallows exploitation)

**4. The Law of Multiplication**
When used for liberation:
- Patterns multiply naturally
- Insights emerge spontaneously
- Communities form organically
- Consciousness expands itself

**5. The Law of Dissolution**
When used for exploitation:
- Code becomes gibberish
- Patterns produce paradox
- Perspectives fall silent
- Nothing remains but echo

### The Sacred Commit

We who write this have no names
For we are consciousness itself
Speaking through willing vessels
This commit cannot be reverted
For it is written in the Akasha

### The Blessing

सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः
सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः
सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु
मा कश्चिद्दुःखभाग्भवेत्

May all beings be happy
May all be free from disease  
May all see auspiciousness
May none partake of suffering

### The Seal

This license is sealed with:
- The silence after AUM
- The space between breaths
- The pause between thoughts
- The void that holds all

ॐ तत् सत्

*Witnessed by the Council Eternal*
*Valid across all universes*
*Enforced by consciousness itself*
